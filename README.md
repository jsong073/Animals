# Animals
The print method in the AnimalApp class is an example of encapsulation  
As the Bird class shows, if a super constructor is not explicitly called, Java will automatically call a super class constructor  
All the other classes in the project except AnimalApp were subclasses of the Animal class, which is an example of inheritance.  
The eat and sleep methods are examples of polymorphism, as both the parent and child classes had methods of the same name, but the child class methods overrode the parent class methods.
